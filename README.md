# Introduction:
According to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) findings from 2017, approximately one in five adults (18.9%) experiences some type of mental health disorder. Yet, in many cases, we’re still relying on individuals to take the initiative and seek treatment, despite the continuing stigma against asking for help for mental health struggles. Mental illness reduces an individual’s quality of life.
Mental health is a sensitive issue garnering increasing attention and awareness in India and around the world. In spite of that, the subject of mental illnesses remains a taboo, with a majority of the population facing lack of awareness or an unwillingness to discuss the issue within their households. The stigma associated with seeking treatment dissuades people from approaching therapists and accessing other available care resources, despite the fact that mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety causes significant negative effects on personal and professional lives of patients. This leads to a high treatment gap for mental health problems in India.

# Heading Towards an AI-based Mental Healthcare System?
AI and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat mental health conditions. In the future, algorithms may be our first line of defence against the mental health struggles that can be debilitating for so many people.It is becoming clear that AI for mental health could be a game changer. Although AI for mental health still needs to deal with many complexities but technology can offer an improved user experience. Good mental health can be at our fingertips.
